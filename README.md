# -Virtual-mouse-using-Hand-Gesture
A virtual mouse using hand gestures is a system that allows users to control the movement and actions of a computer mouse through hand movements and gestures, without the need for a physical mouse. The system uses a camera to capture the user's hand movements, which are then processed and translated into mouse movements on the screen.
